### Dear Sir,

I hereby give you the following notice:

I have purchased a …………… Washing Machine, Model No. …………… bearing Serial No. …………… manufactured by …………… Ltd. from M/s ……………, the distributor of washing machines for Mumbai, on ………………………… for a sum of Rs. …………… vide Invoice No. …………… dated …………….

The said M/s ……………, while selling the washing machine, gave a warranty for a period of **two (2) years**, commencing from …………… to ……………, warranting that the machine would give the best performance and that if any defect, including manufacturing defect, was found in the said washing machine during the warranty period, the service centre of the manufacturer …………… Ltd. would rectify the said defect and, if the defect could not be rectified, the washing machine would be replaced with a new one without any charge to the purchaser.

To my surprise, the said washing machine started giving trouble from the very first day it was put to use. On ……………, I informed the distributor to intimate an engineer from the company’s service centre to inspect the machine and rectify the defects found therein. One Shri …………………, Service Engineer of …………… Ltd., attached to the local service centre, visited my premises and attempted to rectify the defects; however, he was unable to rectify all the defects and left stating that he or another service engineer would visit again on the next day.

On ……………, the said Shri …………………, Service Engineer of …………… Ltd., again reported for rectification of the defects and attempted to repair the washing machine.

Again, on ……………, the said washing machine stopped working. The service centre was once again advised to send a service engineer, who visited on …………. and attempted to rectify the defects. The said service engineer advised that the piece of the washing machine was defective and that it would be better to get the machine replaced, failing which the washing machine would continue to give trouble.

Therefore, on ……………, I requested the vendor of the machine, M/s ……………, to replace the washing machine, as the machine supplied earlier had not been giving satisfactory service from the very first day. The said M/s …………… promised to do the needful in the matter, but nothing has been done to date. Thereafter, again the machine stopped working on ……………, and even the service engineer from the service centre did not visit despite repeated telephonic reminders to the service centre and M/s …………….

By this notice, I hereby call upon you both to **replace the said washing machine**, sold to me on ……………, with a **new washing machine** that gives proper and satisfactory performance, **within a period of …………… days** from the date of receipt of this notice, failing which I shall be constrained to file a complaint for **deficiency in service** before the **District Consumer Forum ……………**, at your entire risk as to costs and consequences.

### Yours faithfully,
