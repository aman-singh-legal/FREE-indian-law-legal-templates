## CASE LAW

1. The liability of the insurer arises only when a judgment is obtained against the insured. The insurer is obliged to pay claimants only the amount due by the insured under an award made by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal.  
   *The Oriental Fire & General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Bachan Singh*, 1982 P.L.R. 280 (P&H) (F.B.).

2. The liability of the insurer to pay a claim arises on the occurrence of the accident, and the law in force on the date of the accident governs the award of compensation and extent of liability.  
   *Tara Pada Roy v. Dwijendra Nath Sen & Ors.*, (1985) 2 A.C.C. 563 (Pat.).

3. The liability of the Insurance Company is co-extensive with the liability of the owner vis-à-vis the vicarious liability of the driver.  
   *United India Fire & General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Gulab Chandra Gupta*, (1985) 1 A.C.C. 52 (All.).

4. An insurer can cover a higher risk than the statutory limit.  
   *United Fire & General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Mrs. Kalsum Begum*, (1986) 2 T.A.C. 397 (Gauhati).

5. Section 95(2) prescribes minimum requirements; insurers may cover greater risks, and liability will be determined accordingly.  
   *United Fire & General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Minaben Harish Chandra*, AIR 1979 Guj. 108.

6. Where policy covers wider risk, the Tribunal may direct the insurer to pay compensation beyond statutory limits.  
   *Assam Corporation v. Binu Rai*, AIR 1975 Gauhati 3.

7. Insurance Company is liable to cover the risk of a hirer/agent or employees travelling with goods in a goods vehicle under Section 95(1).  
   *Harishankar Tiwari v. Jagru*, 1987 (1) A.C.J. 1 (M.P.) (F.B.).

8. Failure of the insurer to produce the insurance policy may justify adverse inference.  
   *United India Fire & Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Natvarlal &*
